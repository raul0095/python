#  7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name,
# then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:

# X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475

# Count these lines and extract the floating point values
# from each of the lines and compute the average of thosevalues
# and produce an output as shown below.
# Average spam confidence: 0.7507185185185187
# Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.

# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
# when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
